\begin{block}{What is ``unnecessary''}
What feels obvious to you when writing the code may not be
obvious to someone else, or even to you at a future time.

\begin{block}{A MATLAB example}
\begin{verbatim}
%   ** USELESS COMMENT **
% compute the mean value of every column of A
B = mean(A,1);

%   ** USEFUL, bsxfun may be obscure! **
% divide every column of A by the column vector v
B = bsxfun(@rdivide,A,v);
\end{verbatim}
\end{block}
